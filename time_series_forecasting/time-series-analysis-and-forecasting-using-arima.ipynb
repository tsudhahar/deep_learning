Sometimes we will refer to trend as “changing direction” when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend.\n\n**Level**:- It basically depicts baseline value for the time series.\n\n**Seasonal**:- As its name depicts it shows the repeated pattern over time. In layman terms, it shows the seasonal variation of data over time.\n\n**Noise**:- It is basically external noises that vary the data randomly.\n\nYou can see below various graphs I plotted and what I inferred from them. which is totally oblivious to us such as stock market prediction, future sales prediction and so on.Time series problem is basically the prediction of such problems using various machine learning tools.Time series problem is tackled efficiently when first it is analyzed properly (Time Series Analysis) and according to that observation suitable algorithm is used (Time Series Forecasting).We'll study both of then later in this notebook.
