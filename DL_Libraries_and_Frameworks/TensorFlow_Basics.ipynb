    "At its core, TensorFlow is a library for efficient multidimensional array operations with a focus on deep learning. Developed by the Google Brain Team, TensorFlow was open-sourced on November 9th, 2015. And augmented by its convenient Python API layer, TensorFlow has gained much popularity and wide-spread adoption in industry as well as academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow shares some similarities with NumPy, such as providing data structures and computations based on multidimensional arrays. What makes TensorFlow particularly suitable for deep learning, though, are its primitives for defining functions on tensors, the ability of parallelizing tensor operations, and convenience tools such as automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While TensorFlow can be run entirely on a CPU or multiple CPUs, one of the core strength of this library is its support of GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) that are very efficient at performing highly parallelized numerical computations. In addition, TensorFlow also supports distributed systems as well as mobile computing platforms, including Android and Apple's iOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is a *tensor*? In simplifying terms, we can think of tensors as multidimensional arrays of numbers, as a generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scalar: $\\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "2. Vector: $\\mathbb{R}^n$\n",
    "3. Matrix: $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^m$\n",
    "4. 3-Tensor: $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^m \\times \\mathbb{R}^p$\n",
    "5. ...\n",
    "\n",
    "When we describe tensors, we refer to its \"dimensions\" as the *rank* (or *order*) of a tensor, which is not to be confused with the dimensions of a matrix. For instance, an $m \\times n$ matrix, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns, would be a special case of a rank-2 tensor. A visual explanation of tensors and their ranks is given is the figure below.\n",
